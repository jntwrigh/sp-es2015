/*
 * Rewrite dlog as a utility function, including:
 * - Change it to an arrow function
 * - Move the code that had relied on a closure into the function itself
 *
 * Then add a function, uniq, which should take an array as input
 * and return the unique elements of that array
 * Make sure that you write it as an arrow function.
 * Go back to Movie.js to ensure that there are only
 * unique genres in the genre collection
 *
 * Export dlog and uniq
